= riff Builder

This repository hosts the files necessary to create the buildpack builder used when
riff builds functions from source with the `riff function create <fn-name>`
command.

== Relation to the https://github.com/projectriff?utf8=âœ“&q=function-buildpack[projectriff/*-function-buildpack] Repositories
In the v3 buildpack ecosystem, a distinction needs to be made between a _buildpack_
and a _builder_.

The latter is what is actually involved when running `riff function create` with the
buildpack approach. A _builder_ is the composition of several _buildpacks_ using groups.
It takes the form of a docker image. In the case of riff, its official location is
https://hub.docker.com/r/projectriff/builder/[projectriff/builder].
The purpose of this repository is to allow the creation of that builder.

The former, a _buildpack_, is a more fine grained unit of logic that can be composed and
collaborate with other buildpacks. The https://github.com/projectriff/java-function-buildpack[projectriff/java-function-buildpack]
repository hosts one of them, responsible for applying the riff-specific logic on top of
the more general _java_ building logic. As more languages become supported by riff,
other riff function buildpacks will be added to collaborate with other buildpacks (_e.g._ `python`), while this
repository's `builder.toml` file will enhance its group(s) to reference _e.g._ the generic
`python` buildpack.

== Building
=== Prerequisites
To build the `projectriff/builder` builder you'll need

* Go 1.13+
* a running local docker daemon
* the https://github.com/buildpack/pack[`pack`] command line tool (for local function builds)

=== Creating the Builder
Then, building the builder is as simple as
[source,bash]
----
# clone to a directory that is not under GOPATH
git clone https://github.com/projectriff/builder
cd builder
make
----

=== Using the Builder Locally
Lastly, to use the builder created above, just refer to the `pack build` reference:
[source, bash]
----
cd where-your-function-is
pack build --builder projectriff/builder --no-pull -p . your-org/my-function
----

You should get something similar to
[source,bash]
